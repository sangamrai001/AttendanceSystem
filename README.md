# Attendance System

**Face Recognition Attendance System** is a Python-based project designed to automate attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The system leverages the `face-recognition` library to identify and mark attendance based on recognized faces from images, and updates a CSV file to maintain attendance records. The system achieves a high accuracy rate of 95%.

## Key Features

- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes the `face-recognition` library to detect and recognize faces from images.
- **Custom GUI**: Features a custom graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.
- **Attendance Marking**: Automatically marks attendance based on face recognition and updates a CSV file with attendance records.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves a recognition accuracy rate of 95%.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **face-recognition**: Library used for face detection and recognition.
- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.
- **CSV**: For storing and updating attendance records.
